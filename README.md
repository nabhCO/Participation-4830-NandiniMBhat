# Participation in 4830 Coding Calculus (for nabh6611)
### About this Repository
This repository is a record of my participation in the class Coding Calculus (4830) in CU Boulder's CSPB program. Participation is organized by the week, with Piazza comments put together in PDFs. 

In the Piazza comments that mention code, I have not included a screenshot of the posted code itself- instead, I have added the Jupyter Notebooks for the code to the relevant week folders.

*Note: For context in some of the screenshots I have included comments from my classmates. To maintain privacy, I have greyed out their names and pictures. My own contributions in these cases are highlighted in blue.*

### Self Assessment
Throughout this course, I have enjoyed taking part in discussions with my classmates- they have helped me numerous times, and I have tried my best to answer their questions and help out where I can with clarifications and code. Overall, I have been very active with my participation, and have definitely gained a lot from it.
